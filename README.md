Changes made from Assignment 1:

universal;
Using a css sheet, I added a more stylized navigation bar at the top of every page.
I also changed all headers to a teal/blue-ish colour.
I added margins to the left and right to help balance and center the pages.

index;
I added a box model to the form submission.

aboutme;
Not much changed here besides just the overall changes from the style sheet.

mydreams;
Again, not much changed here. The images are now boxed, that's about it.
